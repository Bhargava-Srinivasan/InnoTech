## üìñ Description

Across India, students and staff often struggle with the lack of a centralized platform where they can share innovative projects, solve academic queries, and collaborate on groundbreaking ideas.

To address this gap, we have built a dynamic web application that empowers both students and educators to:

 - Upload and showcase project ideas

 - Solve and discuss academic queries

 - Collaborate on ongoing work

 - Connect with peers and mentors based on shared interests

Our platform is designed to foster a vibrant community where innovation thrives through collaboration.

Features such as personalized profiles, content tagging, comments, and resource sharing make it easy for users to contribute meaningfully and build impactful networks.
