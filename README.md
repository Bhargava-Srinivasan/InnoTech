To address this gap, we have built a dynamic web application that empowers both students and educators to:

 - Upload and showcase project ideas

 - Solve and discuss academic queries

 - Collaborate on ongoing work

 - Connect with peers and mentors based on shared interests

Our platform is designed to foster a vibrant community where innovation thrives through collaboration.
